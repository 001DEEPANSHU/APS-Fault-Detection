Introduction
-------------------
One of the leading truck manufacturing companies, Scania Vehicles, has the data regarding the APS (air pressure system), 
a component of trucks. The Scania company is particularly interested in learning if the failure is connected to the APS or not 
among all the other parts in the truck.

Business Problem
-------------------
A heavy-duty vehicle's Air Pressure System (APS) is a crucial part that uses compressed air to push a piston and provide pressure 
to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The ease of obtaining and long-term sustainability of natural air make an APS preferable 
to a hydraulic system.

The operational cost of Scania truck fleet can be significantly reduced by accurate prediction of the failure status of APS based 
on the measurements of truck mechanical system attributes. In essence, the goal is to cut down on the extra time and effort required for pointless 
APS checks.
